---

## Paradigm shift in vocational education
>The processes of technological, social, economic and ecological change since the 1980s described above also have far-reaching consequences for vocational education. Arnold/Lipsmeier/Ott describe this process as a paradigm shift, which is illustrated in the following figure (paradigm = "example, pattern" – Duden German Spelling, 2013; "system of rules, pattern, model" – Microsoft Encarta 99).

---

### Didactic reorientation

>Newer didactic concepts aim at the development of professional competence and personality development and promotion. The consequences are demands for holistic learning, student-oriented learning organisation, activity-promoting training and teaching methods, and, in general, action and problem-solving skills.

---

### Changing role of trainers and teachers

>Above all, this requires a new role for trainers and teachers, with a shift from teaching and leadership-oriented activities to organising, advising and moderating activities.  

>Arnold/Lipsmeier/Ott use this as the basis for their concept of holistic learning, which is characterised by the following features (cf. ibid., 22):

---

### Features of holistic learning

- **Self-regulation and self-control** – one's own learning behaviour should be subject to constant didactic and methodological self-control  

- **Individualisation of learning content** – this is intended to achieve adaptation to subjective and  cognitive learning requirements;  

- **Communication and interaction** – this is intended to ensure support for the required self-regulation and self-control of learning, as well as to achieve social and communicative learning goals.

---

### Structural change in teaching

>The general trend away from teacher-centred teaching with a linear teaching structure towards student-centred teaching with a self-learning structure is discussed in the lecture using the example in the following figure.

## Question 1.1: Understanding the Paradigm Shift

What constitutes the fundamental paradigm shift in vocational education described in the material, and what are its primary drivers?

[[ ]] The shift is primarily driven by digital technology adoption in training centers
[[X]] The shift represents a fundamental reorientation from teacher-centered instruction to learner-centered competence development, driven by technological, social, economic, and ecological changes since the 1980s
[[ ]] The paradigm shift focuses solely on updating curriculum content to match modern workplace requirements
[[ ]] The change is limited to incorporating new teaching technologies without altering fundamental pedagogical approaches
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

The paradigm shift represents a comprehensive transformation in vocational education philosophy and practice. It is not merely about technology or content updates, but a fundamental reorientation of the entire educational approach driven by multiple interconnected factors - technological, social, economic, and ecological changes since the 1980s.

</section>
***

---

   ## Question 1.2: Features of Holistic Learning

Arnold/Lipsmeier/Ott describe three key features of holistic learning. Select ALL statements that correctly describe how these features interconnect:

[[X]] Self-regulation and self-control provide the foundation for individualizing learning content
[[X]] Communication and interaction support self-regulation by providing learners with feedback mechanisms
[[X]] Individualization of learning content requires enhanced communication structures for appropriate guidance
[[ ]] Self-control eliminates the need for communication since learners work independently
[[ ]] Individualization and self-regulation function independently of each other
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

The three features work synergistically: self-regulation enables learners to monitor their progress, individualization responds to cognitive needs identified through self-regulation, and communication provides the social framework necessary for effective self-regulation while achieving social learning goals.

</section>
***

---

   ## Question 1.3: Structural Change in Teaching

What are the most significant differences between "Linear instructional structure" and "Networked self-learning structure" regarding content and teacher/learner relationships?

[[ ]] In both structures, content remains the central organizing principle
[[X]] In the linear structure, content flows hierarchically from teacher to learner; in networked structure, learners appropriate content through active engagement with diverse resources while the teacher facilitates
[[ ]] The networked structure eliminates structured content since learners create their own curriculum
[[ ]] Both maintain the same teacher-learner power dynamic but differ in pacing
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

Linear structure follows Teaching → Instruction → Guidance with the teacher as central mediator. Networked structure follows Learning → Appropriation → Independence with the learner at the center, accessing multiple resources (media, ICT, network partners, advisors). The teacher transforms from director to facilitator/advisor.

</section>
***

---

   ## Question 1.4: Changing Role of Trainers and Teachers

The shift from "teaching and leadership-oriented activities" to "organizing, advising, and moderating activities" implies what for professional development of educators?

[[ ]] Teachers require less training since they are no longer responsible for direct instruction
[[X]] Educators must develop new competencies in facilitation, curriculum design for self-directed learning, diagnostic assessment, and individualized guidance strategies
[[ ]] The new role simply involves less work as students take more responsibility
[[ ]] Advising and moderating are easier than teaching, requiring minimal retraining
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

The transformation is demanding: educators need new skill sets including diagnostic competence, ability to design flexible learning environments, coaching and mentoring skills, and competence in moderating group processes. This role is arguably more complex than traditional teaching.

</section>
***

---

   ## Question 1.5: The DQR Competence Framework

According to the German Qualifications Framework (DQR), analyze the following statements and select ALL that are accurate:

[[X]] Professional competence is subdivided into knowledge (depth and breadth) and skills (instrumental, systemic, and judgment capability)
[[X]] Personal competence encompasses both social competence and independence
[[X]] Methodological competence is a cross-cutting competence not specifically mentioned as a separate dimension in the DQR matrix
[[ ]] Skills are limited to manual abilities only
[[X]] The DQR's understanding aligns with §1 BBiG's definition of professional action competence
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

The DQR structures competence comprehensively: Professional competence (Knowledge + Skills), Personal competence (Social competence + Independence). Methodological competence permeates all dimensions. This aligns with BBiG §1 defining vocational training as developing comprehensive action competence for changing work environments.

## Holistic vocational education and holistic learning

>As a didactic consequence of the developments of the 1987 reorganisation process, the concept of holistic vocational education was developed at universities in southern Germany (cf. Ott, 1995; Arnold/Lipsmeier/Ott, 1998, 25 ff).

---

### Integrated goals of holistic vocational education

According to this approach, holistic vocational education integrates

- **The goal of professional competence as a requirement**, alongside increased cognitive demands, to strive "above all for a pronounced personal and methodological competence, conveyed through so-called key qualifications of a material, social and formal nature"  (Arnold/Lipsmeier/Ott, 1998, 25). 

- **The goal of personal development** in the context of the goal of professional maturity described by Lipsmeier (1982) (cf. the definition in Arnold/Lipsmeier/Ott, ibid).

### Structural features

### Holistic learning as implementation approach

>The implementation of holistic vocational training is pursued in the "Holistic Vocational Training" concept through the approach of holistic learning, which was developed in particular by Ott.  

>According to this approach, holistic learning is based on holistic content structuring 88 and refers to four types of learning (Arnold/Lipsmeier/Ott, 1998, 26; see following figure)

### Four types of learning

- **Content-related learning** – cognitive abilities and motor skills;  

- **Methodical problem-solving learning** – mastery and application of basic learning and working techniques;  

- **Social-communicative learning** – mastery of basic cooperation and communication techniques;  

- **Affective-ethical learning** – acting independently, developing areas of interest and life plans ...

---

### KMK perspective on competence

>It should be noted that the KMK has formulated a slightly different concept of competence, which, among other things, was also used as the basis for the North Rhine-Westphalian curriculum model for the newly structured electrical and metalworking professions.  

>In particular, methodological competence is understood here as a sub-area of technical, human and social competence (whereby human competence is used in the same context as the term individual competence used by Ott), and learning competence is identified as an independent area of competence alongside methodological competence.  

This will be discussed in more detail in the lecture.

## Question 2.1: Goals of Holistic Vocational Education

According to the concept of holistic vocational education developed in southern Germany, what two primary integrated goals does this approach pursue?

[[X]] Professional competence (including key qualifications of material, social and formal nature) and personal development toward professional maturity
[[ ]] Standardization of training procedures and measurable learning outcomes
[[ ]] Cost reduction in training programs and increased employer satisfaction
[[ ]] Focus exclusively on technical skills and workplace efficiency
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

Holistic vocational education integrates two fundamental goals: (1) professional competence with pronounced personal and methodological competence through key qualifications, and (2) personal development in the context of professional maturity as described by Lipsmeier.

</section>
***

---

   ## Question 2.2: Four Types of Learning

Holistic learning is based on four types of learning. Match each type with its primary competence development focus:

What competence does "Content-related learning" primarily develop?

[[ ]] Methodological competence
[[X]] Professional competence (cognitive abilities and motor skills)
[[ ]] Social competence
[[ ]] Individual competence
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

According to the diagram, methodological-operational learning is the foundation that leads to both "Learning and Work Techniques" (e.g., selective reading, problem-solving methods) and "Cooperation and Communication Techniques" (e.g., team development, conflict management).

</section>
***

---

   ## Question 2.4: KMK's Concept of Competence

How does the KMK's (Kultusministerkonferenz) perspective on competence differ from Ott's approach to holistic vocational training?

[[X]] KMK treats methodological competence as a sub-area of technical, human and social competence, and identifies learning competence as an independent area
[[ ]] KMK completely rejects the concept of methodological competence
[[ ]] KMK and Ott's approaches are identical in structure and terminology
[[ ]] KMK focuses only on technical competence, ignoring personal development
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

The KMK formulated a slightly different concept where methodological competence is understood as a sub-area of technical, human (individual) and social competence, rather than as a separate dimension. Additionally, KMK identifies learning competence as an independent area alongside methodological competence.

</section>
***

---

   ## Question 2.5: Integration of Learning Types

Holistic learning integrates four interconnected types of learning. Why is this integration essential rather than treating each type separately?

[[ ]] Integration simplifies assessment by reducing the number of evaluation categories
[[X]] Integration ensures that cognitive, methodological, social, and personal development occur simultaneously, reflecting the holistic nature of professional competence
[[ ]] Integration is primarily an administrative convenience for curriculum planning
[[ ]] Each type actually functions independently; integration is only conceptual
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

The integration is fundamental to holistic learning because professional competence in practice requires simultaneous engagement of cognitive abilities, methodological strategies, social interactions, and personal attitudes. Separating these artificially would undermine the development of comprehensive action competence.

</section>
***

---
**Explanation:**

Content-related learning focuses on cognitive abilities and motor skills, developing professional competence. The other types are: Methodical problem-solving learning (methodological competence), Social-communicative learning (social competence), and Affective-ethical learning (individual competence).

</section>
***

---

   ## Question 2.3: Learning and Work Techniques

In the structural features of holistic vocational training, "Learning and Work Techniques" and "Cooperation and Communication Techniques" emerge from which type of learning?

[[ ]] Content-related learning
[[X]] Methodological-operational learning
[[ ]] Affective-ethical learning
[[ ]] Social-communicative learning directly

## Action orientation and an expanded concept of learning – consequences for the design of learning processes

Nashan/Ott (1995, 106 f.) have developed a fundamental didactic-methodological structure for action-based learning from this:

### Action-based learning structure

- **Problem and objective**  
with various details on the task, conditions and requirements for the result (system to be designed, etc.) in the form of a specification sheet;  

- **Problem structuring**  
with the definition of the decisions required for the implementation phase (such as work/problem-solving plan) by the pupils;  

- **Execution**  
with the creation of a product (e.g. through the design and manufacture of a technical system);  

- **Evaluation and assessment**  
with a review of the design and cooperation process and an assessment of possible (technological, economic, ecological and political-social) consequences of the technology.

---

### Learning loop model

>For the problem-solving process, the learning loop model was presented with four characteristic learning situations (see figure), which may be repeated several times in more complex problem-solving processes.

### Constructivist learning perspective

>Based on their understanding of constructivist learning concepts, Arnold and Krämer-Stürzl have outlined the implications for the design of learning processes in vocational education in a "Guide to training practice in production and service occupations".

---

## Question 3.1: Action-Oriented Learning Structure

Nashan/Ott developed a fundamental didactic-methodological structure for action-based learning. What are the four main phases of this structure?

[[X]] Problem and objective, Problem structuring, Execution, Evaluation and assessment
[[ ]] Planning, Implementation, Testing, Deployment
[[ ]] Theory, Practice, Reflection, Application
[[ ]] Instruction, Demonstration, Practice, Examination
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

The action-based learning structure follows four phases: (1) Problem and objective with specifications, (2) Problem structuring with work/problem-solving plans by learners, (3) Execution creating a product, and (4) Evaluation and assessment reviewing the process and consequences.

</section>
***

---

   ## Question 3.2: Learning Loop Model

The learning loop model presents four characteristic learning situations that may be repeated in complex problem-solving processes. What is the primary purpose of this iterative structure?

[[ ]] To allow teachers to assess students multiple times
[[X]] To enable learners to progressively refine their understanding and problem-solving approaches through repeated cycles of action and reflection
[[ ]] To ensure students spend more time on training activities
[[ ]] To standardize learning outcomes across different contexts
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

The iterative learning loop structure allows for progressive refinement: learners engage with problems, reflect on outcomes, adjust their approaches, and repeat the cycle. This supports deep learning and the development of sophisticated problem-solving strategies rather than one-time application.

</section>
***

---

   ## Question 3.3: Expanded Concept of Learning

The "Expanded concept of learning" framework presents four dimensions. Which dimension focuses on "actively planned and conscious acquisition and selection of content"?

[[ ]] Content-related learning
[[X]] Methodological strategic learning
[[ ]] Social-communicative learning
[[ ]] Affective learning
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

Methodological strategic learning is focused on actively planned and conscious acquisition and selection of content, including techniques like excerpting, structuring content, organizing learning times and locations, and selecting relevant learning content.

</section>
***

---

   ## Question 3.4: Four Learning Dimensions Integration

In the expanded concept of learning, "Affective learning" focuses on which primary aspect?

[[ ]] Mastering specific technical skills
[[ ]] Planning and organizing study time
[[X]] A positive, meaningful and personal approach to content leading to self-confidence and values development
[[ ]] Cooperating effectively with team members
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

Affective learning is focused on a positive, meaningful and personal approach to content that enriches personality, leading to developing self-confidence, enjoyment of topics/methods, developing identification and commitment, and establishing values.

</section>
***

---

   ## Question 3.5: Constructivist Learning Perspective

Arnold and Krämer-Stürzl outlined implications of constructivist learning concepts for vocational education. What is the fundamental shift in perspective that constructivism brings to learning design?

[[X]] Learning is understood as an active construction of knowledge by learners rather than passive reception of transmitted information
[[ ]] Learning is best achieved through highly structured, sequential instruction
[[ ]] Teachers should provide all necessary information to minimize learner confusion
[[ ]] Assessment should focus exclusively on memorization of facts
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

The constructivist perspective fundamentally shifts from viewing learning as knowledge transmission to understanding it as active knowledge construction by learners. This has profound implications for designing learning processes that support learner agency, authentic problem-solving, and personal meaning-making.

## From content systematics to competence orientation

>The change in perspective in vocational education and training from a qualification orientation – dominated more by industrial sociology – to an orientation towards the development of competencies can be well described by the following illustration by Rauner.

###  Concept of competence

>"Competence is understood as the willingness and ability of individuals to behave in a manner that is appropriate, well-considered, and socially responsible in professional, social, and private situations. Competence develops in the dimensions of professional competence, personal competence, and social competence."


  
---

### KMK guidelines – areas of competence

* __Professional competence __refers to the "willingness and ability to solve tasks and problems in a goal-oriented, appropriate, methodical and independent manner on the basis of professional knowledge and skills, and to evaluate the results."

*  __Personal competence__ refers to the "willingness and ability to clarify, think through and assess the development opportunities, requirements and limitations in family and public life, to develop one's own talents, and to formulate and develop life plans."

*  __Social competence__ refers to the "willingness and ability to live and shape social relationships, to recognise and understand affection and tensions and to deal with and communicate with others in a rational and responsible manner."

---

### Additional competence areas

>Three further areas of competence are explicitly emphasised: "Methodological competence, communicative competence and learning competence are an intrinsic part of professional competence, self-competence and social competence." 


## Question 4.1: Qualifications vs. Competences - Object-Subject Reference

According to Rauner's analysis, how do qualifications and competences differ in their object-subject reference?

[[X]] Qualifications are objectively defined by work tasks and processes; competences are domain-specific abilities as psychological performance dispositions open to application
[[ ]] Qualifications focus on personal development while competences focus on job requirements
[[ ]] Both qualifications and competences are identically defined by workplace demands
[[ ]] Qualifications are subjective preferences while competences are objective standards
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

Qualifications are objectively defined by work tasks and processes and the resulting qualification requirements. Competences, in contrast, are domain-specific abilities and strategies as psychological performance dispositions that are open to application in various contexts.

</section>
***

---

   ## Question 4.2: Learning - Qualifications vs. Competences

In the process of acquiring qualifications vs. competences, what is the fundamental difference in how the learner is conceptualized?

[[X]] In qualification acquisition, the person is a "carrier medium for qualifications" (human resource); in competence acquisition, it's part of personal development including educational objectives
[[ ]] Qualification acquisition focuses on personal growth while competence acquisition focuses on workplace skills
[[ ]] Both approaches view the learner identically as a developing professional
[[ ]] Qualification acquisition emphasizes autonomy while competence acquisition emphasizes conformity
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

This is a critical distinction: qualification orientation treats the human being as a "carrier medium for qualifications" - a resource enabled through training. Competence orientation treats acquisition as part of personal development, including abilities that result from broader educational objectives.

</section>
***

---

   ## Question 4.3: Objectifiability

Regarding objectifiability, how do qualifications and competences differ in their focus?

[[X]] Qualifications describe not-yet-objectified skills derived from work processes; competences focus on abilities difficult to objectify that go beyond current tasks to address future challenges
[[ ]] Qualifications are completely subjective while competences are fully objectifiable
[[ ]] Both are equally objectifiable and measurable
[[ ]] Qualifications focus on future skills while competences focus on current tasks
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

Qualifications describe the not-yet-objectified/mechanised skills and abilities, defining the person as carrier of qualifications derived from work processes. Professional competences focus on abilities of skilled workers that are not or only difficult to objectify, go beyond current tasks, and aim at solving future challenges.

</section>
***

---

  ## Question 4.4: KMK Definition of Professional Competence

According to KMK guidelines, professional competence refers to what specific capabilities?

[[X]] The willingness and ability to solve tasks and problems in a goal-oriented, appropriate, methodical and independent manner based on professional knowledge and skills, and to evaluate results
[[ ]] The ability to follow instructions and complete assigned tasks efficiently
[[ ]] The capacity to memorize and recall technical information accurately
[[ ]] The skill to work collaboratively without questioning established procedures
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

The KMK defines professional competence comprehensively as willingness and ability to solve tasks and problems goal-oriented, appropriately, methodically and independently based on professional knowledge and skills, AND to evaluate the results. This emphasizes autonomous problem-solving and critical evaluation, not just task completion.

</section>
***

---

  ## Question 4.5: Three Competence Dimensions

The KMK conceptualizes competence development in three main dimensions. Select ALL that correctly describe these dimensions:

[[X]] Professional competence: solving tasks methodically and evaluating results
[[X]] Personal competence: clarifying development opportunities, developing talents, formulating life plans
[[X]] Social competence: shaping relationships, dealing with tensions, communicating responsibly
[[ ]] Technical competence: operating machinery and following safety procedures
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

The three KMK competence dimensions are: (1) Professional competence - task-solving, methodical work, evaluation; (2) Personal competence - self-development, assessing opportunities, life planning; (3) Social competence - relationship management, understanding tensions, responsible communication. Note that methodological, communicative, and learning competences are intrinsic parts of these three dimensions.

Action-oriented training methods were developed to support competence-based learning. Examples include the four-stage method, the guided text method, and project-based learning. These methods promote independent planning, execution, and evaluation of tasks. Instead of following fixed instructions, learners actively engage with real problems and learning materials. The goal is to develop professional action competence by combining learning, working, and reflection in meaningful learning situations.

## Action-oriented training methods

>Along with the discussion of key qualifications, there was a demand at the end of the 1980s for the introduction of action-oriented training methods. While course-oriented training based on the socalled four-stage method was the prevailing ideal for company training programmes until the mid- 1980s, new concepts increasingly developed that were based on the idea of independently organised training using self-study materials

### Methodological development

>The overview of the development from the largely non-independent course method to the largely independent project method outlines the use of new methodological concepts in company (and inter-company) training.

>Two typical training methods are discussed in more detail in the lecture and, above all, compared with regard to their characteristic action and learning steps: the four-stage method and the guided text method.

---

### Four-stage method

>The four-step method was developed during the Second World War in American industry as part of the Training Within Industry (TWI) programme and was later adapted in Germany by the REFA. Association (today: Association for Work Studies and Business Organisation) for in-company instruction in industrial training workshops. The starting point is the analysis of the work activities of experienced industrial workers. This involves a work tasks, work processes, work equipment and work organisation are planned and documented.

### Critical evaluation of the four-stage method

>The four-stage method is clearly to be regarded as a trainer-centred teaching method, which cannot meet the requirements of the 1987 reorganisation process – to ensure independent planning, implementation and monitoring in training (according to the standard wording in all training regulations published after 1987). As a central method that can be used to better achieve the new objectives of the training regulations

## Question 5.1: Development of Training Methods

The overview presents a development from "course method" to "project method." What is the fundamental dimension along which these methods are organized?

[[ ]] From simple to complex content
[[X]] From dependent to independent learning, with increasing learner autonomy
[[ ]] From practical to theoretical approaches
[[ ]] From individual to group-based learning
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

The diagram explicitly shows an axis from "dependent" to "independent," illustrating that the evolution of training methods represents a progression toward increasing learner autonomy and self-organization. Course-based methods are more dependent (instructor-led), while project methods are largely self-organized.

</section>
***

---

 ## Question 5.2: Four-Stage Method

The four-stage method is characteristic of course-oriented training. What is the primary pedagogical principle underlying this method?

[[ ]] Learners discover procedures through unsupervised exploration
[[X]] Systematic instructor-led progression through preparation, demonstration, imitation, and practice stages
[[ ]] Peer-to-peer learning without instructor involvement
[[ ]] Self-paced learning using technology-based tutorials
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

The four-stage method follows a systematic, instructor-controlled progression: (1) preparation and motivation, (2) demonstration by instructor, (3) imitation by learner, (4) practice and consolidation. This represents a highly structured, dependent learning approach typical of traditional course-based training.

</section>
***

---

  ## Question 5.3: Guided Text Method

The guided text method represents an intermediate position between course-based and project methods. Which characteristic features distinguish it from traditional course methods?

[[X]] Uses guiding questions and texts that enable more learner autonomy while providing structure and support
[[ ]] Completely eliminates instructor involvement in the learning process
[[ ]] Focuses exclusively on theoretical knowledge without practical application
[[ ]] Requires learners to develop their own learning materials from scratch
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

The guided text method uses structured materials (guided texts, guiding questions) that provide scaffolding while enabling greater learner autonomy than traditional courses. Learners work more independently but within a supportive framework, representing an intermediate level of independence.

</section>
***

---

  ## Question 5.4: Guided Text Method Learning Cycle

The guided text method follows a six-step cycle. Place these steps in the correct order conceptually:

What is the correct sequence of the guided text method?

[[X]] Informing → Planning → Deciding → Executing → Checking → Evaluating
[[ ]] Planning → Deciding → Informing → Executing → Checking → Evaluating
[[ ]] Informing → Executing → Checking → Planning → Deciding → Evaluating
[[ ]] Deciding → Planning → Informing → Executing → Evaluating → Checking
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

The guided text method follows a logical cycle: (1) Informing (What is to be done? - guiding questions), (2) Planning (How to proceed? - work plan), (3) Deciding (defining process/resources - technical discussion), (4) Executing (manufacturing - order processing), (5) Checking (quality inspection), (6) Evaluating (improvement reflection).

</section>
***

---

  ## Question 5.5: Project Method Characteristics

"Largely self-organised projects" and "assumption of (partial) tasks from production" represent the project method. What are the key pedagogical advantages of this approach?

[[X]] Develops learner autonomy, integrates authentic work tasks, promotes comprehensive problem-solving and responsibility
[[ ]] Reduces instructor workload by eliminating preparation requirements
[[ ]] Simplifies assessment through standardized project templates
[[ ]] Eliminates the need for theoretical knowledge by focusing only on practice
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

The project method's advantages include: development of learner autonomy and independence, integration of authentic workplace tasks, promotion of comprehensive problem-solving (technical, social, methodological), development of personal responsibility, and preparation for real-world professional challenges. It represents the highest level of learner independence in the methodological progression.

# Block 6:  Work and business processes and professional competence
    --{{0}}--
“Modern vocational training is increasingly oriented toward real work and business processes. Training regulations emphasize professional competence as the ability to perform complex tasks within these processes. Learning takes place through real tasks in authentic work environments. This approach supports experience-based and self-directed learning. By linking competence development with actual business processes, vocational education prepares learners to adapt to technological change and future professional requirements.”

## Work and business processes and professional competence as design principles for new occupations

>The vocational classification procedures carried out in recent years clearly show the extent to which the guidelines described have now been incorporated into vocational training and incorporated into vocational development. This can be traced in various occupational fields. A good example is the latest reorganisation procedure for the electrical professions.


>In the Ordinance on Vocational Training in Industrial Electrical Professions (2007; all new training regulations have been designed in a similar manner to date): "Within the framework of job-specific professional qualifications, professional competence (...) must be expanded anddeepened enabling the comprehensive performance of complex tasks in the respective business process" (2007, § 3). And the industry associations responsible for electrical engineering and information technology (BITKOM, VDMA and ZVEI) list the following design principles for the reorganisation of industrial electrical professions to explain their intentions:

> Process orientation, flexibility, professional competence and learning on the job – the latter understood as competence development for experience-led and self-directed working and learning (see figure above). Training should enable professional action, and it goes on to say: "Training on real tasks, in current business operations and in a typical social environment is particularly important for the development of professional competence" (BITKOM/VDMA/ZVEI 2007, p. 2 f.).In addition to the focus on work and business processes, publications on new occupations in particular emphasise the concept of professional competence (cf. Jenewein 2012, p. 52 ff.).

### Training on real tasks

>The concept of professional competence is also addressed in the discussion on European evelopments. A study by the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training uses the example in the figure above to show how the dimensions of vocational competence (referred to here as subject reference) can be linked to individual fields of action from work and business processes (referred to as context reference) to create a model for modelling competence standards. These upcoming processes will be discussed in the lecture using this figure as an example. These aspects can be explored in greater depth in further seminars offered by the Chair of Vocational Education and Training on European vocational training policy and the introduction of the European Credit System for Vocational Education and Training (ECVET).


> So far, the competency model has not yet been used for the development of company training regulations; here, competencies are still not differentiated, but are summarised in the column "Skills, knowledge and abilities to be taught". One example is the training regulation for insurance and finance clerks, as shown in the following figure: The 2014 amendment also presents the factual structure of the training programme by means of company fields of activity, which are specified in the column "Skills, knowledge and abilities to be taught".

### European and national frameworks

>The Main Committee of the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training has issued a recommendation for new classification procedures, which is quoted below. The inclusion of the concept of competence is based on the work on the European and German qualifications frameworks (this will be discussed in detail in the following seminars) and is to be implemented in the training regulations that will be issued in the coming years.

>Professional competence within the meaning of the BBiG/HWO and the DQR's understanding of competence Practical and comprehensible training regulations are an important basis for in￾company training. When designing training regulations, legal and educational policy requirements must be taken into account and corresponding developments promoted.

### European and national frameworks

This also includes the competence-oriented presentation of training content as a prerequisite for 
comprehensive comparability and permeability in accordance with the German and European 
Qualifications Framework (DQR/EQR).
The design of training regulations is based on the understanding of competence that underlies the 
German Qualifications Framework for Lifelong Learning (DQR): "Competence
139
in the DQR refers to the ability and willingness of individuals to use knowledge and skills as well as 
personal, social and methodological abilities and to behave in a thoughtful, individual and socially 
responsible manner. In this sense, competence is understood as comprehensive action 
competence." In the DQR, competence is represented in the dimensions of professional 
competence, subdivided into knowledge and skills, and personal competence, subdivided into 
social competence and independence.
### European and national frameworks

 >Methodological competence is understood as a cross-cutting competence and is therefore not specifically mentioned in the DQR matrix. The competence to act in the DQR corresponds to the professional competence to act within the meaning of §1 BBiG: "Vocational training shall impart the vocational skills, knowledge and abilities (vocational competence) necessary for the exercise of a qualified vocational activity in a changing world of work in a structured training programme. It shall also enable the acquisition of the necessary professional experience."

   ## Recommendation of the BIBB Main Committee

>The inclusion of the concept of competence is based on the work on the European and German qualifications frameworks and is to be implemented in the training regulations that will be issued in the coming years.

>Recommendation of the Main Committee of the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training of 26 June 2014 – amended on 21 June 2016 – on the structure and design of training regulations – training occupation profile, training framework plan (excerpt)

# Question 6.1: Design Principles for New Occupations

The reorganization of industrial electrical professions (2007 Ordinance) lists specific design principles. Select ALL that are explicitly mentioned:

[[X]] Process orientation
[[X]] Flexibility
[[X]] Professional competence
[[X]] Learning on the job (competence development for experience-led and self-directed working and learning)
[[ ]] Cost reduction
[[ ]] Standardized testing
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

The BITKOM/VDMA/ZVEI associations explicitly list four design principles: (1) Process orientation, (2) Flexibility, (3) Professional competence, and (4) Learning on the job - understood as competence development for experience-led and self-directed working and learning. These principles guide the design of modern training regulations.

</section>

  ## Question 6.2: Professional Action Competence (Berufliche Handlungskompetenz)

The concept of "Berufliche Handlungskompetenz" (professional action competence) is organized along two dimensions. What are these dimensions?

[[X]] Competence dimensions (subject reference): Professional, Methodological, Social, and Personal competence
[[X]] Fields of action (context reference): Work and business process areas (Handlungsfeld 1, 2, 3, N)
[[ ]] Time dimensions: Short-term, medium-term, and long-term competencies
[[ ]] Difficulty levels: Basic, intermediate, and advanced skills
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

Professional action competence is modeled as a matrix with two dimensions: (1) Competence dimensions (Subjektbezug) - Professional competence (Fachliche), Methodological competence (Methodische), Social competence (Soziale), Personal competence (Personale); (2) Fields of action (Kontextbezug) - specific areas from work and business processes.

</section>

  ## Question 6.3: Training on Real Tasks

According to the material, why is "training on real tasks, in current business operations and in a typical social environment" particularly important?

[[X]] It is essential for the development of professional competence because it enables learning in authentic contexts with genuine challenges and social interactions
[[ ]] It reduces training costs by eliminating the need for specialized training facilities
[[ ]] It simplifies assessment by using workplace performance as the only measure
[[ ]] It allows companies to use trainees as regular employees without additional compensation
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

Training on real tasks is emphasized because professional competence develops most effectively when learners engage with authentic workplace challenges, current business operations, and typical social environments. This authentic learning context is crucial for developing the ability to handle real professional situations independently.

</section>
***

---

   ## Question 6.4: Integration with European Frameworks (ECVET/EQF)

The competence model linking dimensions with fields of action serves what purpose in the European context?

[[X]] Creates a framework for modeling competence standards that enables comparability and recognition of qualifications across European countries
[[ ]] Eliminates the need for national training regulations in favor of European standards
[[ ]] Simplifies training by reducing the number of competencies that must be developed
[[ ]] Focuses exclusively on theoretical knowledge to ensure consistency
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

This competence model provides a structured framework for developing competence standards that can be compared and recognized across European educational systems (through ECVET - European Credit System for VET, and EQF - European Qualifications Framework), supporting mobility and lifelong learning.

</section>
***

---

  ## Question 6.5: DQR Definition and BBiG Alignment

How does the DQR's understanding of competence align with the Vocational Training Act (BBiG) §1?

[[X]] Both emphasize comprehensive action competence: DQR focuses on ability and willingness to use knowledge, skills, and personal/social abilities responsibly; BBiG focuses on vocational competence for qualified activity in a changing world of work
[[ ]] They are completely contradictory frameworks that cannot be reconciled
[[ ]] DQR focuses only on academic qualifications while BBiG focuses only on practical skills
[[ ]] BBiG has been completely replaced by the DQR framework
***
<section>

**Explanation:**

The DQR defines competence as "ability and willingness to use knowledge and skills as well as personal, social and methodological abilities and to behave thoughtfully, individually and socially responsibly" - comprehensive action competence. BBiG §1 defines vocational training as imparting "vocational skills, knowledge and abilities (vocational competence) necessary for qualified vocational activity in a changing world of work." Both emphasize comprehensive capability for responsible professional action.

# Reflection and Integration

After completing this comprehensive quiz, consider these integrative reflection questions:

## Cross-Block Integration Questions

1. **Paradigm Evolution:** How do the concepts progress from Block 1's paradigm shift through to Block 7's focus on work processes and professional competence? What is the logical connection between these developments?

2. **Competence Development:** Compare and contrast how different blocks (2, 4, and 7) conceptualize competence. What are the common threads and what are the unique contributions of each perspective?

3. **Methodological Progression:** Trace the development of training methods from Block 3's action orientation through Block 6's method spectrum. How do pedagogical theories translate into practical training approaches?

4. **European Integration:** How do the national German developments (BBiG, DQR) integrate with European frameworks (EQF, ECVET)? What are the benefits and challenges of this integration?

5. **Teacher/Trainer Role:** Across all blocks, how has the role of the educator evolved? What competencies must modern vocational educators possess that differ from traditional instructors?

## Practical Application Questions

1. **Curriculum Design:** If you were designing a new vocational training program, how would you integrate principles from holistic learning, action orientation, and competence-based frameworks?

2. **Assessment Challenge:** How would you assess comprehensive professional action competence in a way that honors the complexity of the competence dimensions while remaining practical?

3. **Technology Integration:** How might digital technologies and AI support or challenge the pedagogical principles outlined across these blocks?

4. **Workplace Partnership:** What specific ways could training institutions and workplaces collaborate to implement "training on real tasks" effectively?

5. **International Mobility:** Design a strategy for making vocational qualifications from your context recognizable and comparable in the European framework.

# Conclusion

This comprehensive quiz has covered fundamental concepts in modern vocational education:

- The paradigm shift toward learner-centered competence development
- Holistic approaches integrating multiple learning dimensions
- Action-oriented pedagogies emphasizing authentic problem-solving
- The transition from qualification to competence orientation
- Progressive training methods from instructor-led to self-organized learning
- Integration of work processes with professional competence development

These concepts represent decades of educational research and practical development in vocational education systems, particularly in Germany and Europe. Understanding these foundations is essential for anyone working in vocational education policy, curriculum development, teacher training, or educational research.

**Remember:** Professional competence is not just about what you know, but about your ability and willingness to act competently, responsibly, and adaptively in complex professional situations. This requires ongoing development across all competence dimensions - professional, methodological, social, and personal.
