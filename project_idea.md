# Project Based Focus Seminar
  ### Option 1

  You work at a large multidisciplinary school and are asked to give a presentation in your department on the occasion of a visit by the minister to your department, in which you outline the requirements for vocational training for Ind 5.0, the organization and subject-oriented didactics from reliable sources, and give an example of how VET 6.0 could be implemented in the future. To this end, you are to form a project group that works according to a project management model, in which each member takes on a task and carries it out responsibly. The results are to be documented in a DMS.

# Core concept: 

You will be expected to research and summarise developments relating to Ind 5.0. From this, you will derive a prototype for a next-generation vocational education and training system (VET 6.0) in which AI does not replace human teaching, but creates personalized, adaptive learning pathways that connect learners, master craftspeople, industry partners, and community needs in real-time.

The project could focus on following Key VET 6.0 elements. Think out - of -the-box you are not just limited to this:

* Human-AI collaboration in learning: Learners have AI "learning companions" that track competency development across formal and informal settings, suggest projects based on regional industry needs, and facilitate peer-to-peer knowledge transfer across companies and borders.
* Competency-based micro-credentials on blockchain: Digital portfolios that capture skills development through verifiable, stackable credentials - moving beyond traditional certification timelines to recognize just-in-time learning.
* Regional resilience focus and sustainability: Rather than purely global supply chains, VET prepares workers for localized, sustainable production - repair culture, circular economy skills, community-based manufacturing using advanced tech like 3D printing and AI-assisted design.
* Intergenerational knowledge networks: Master craftspeople use AI tools to document tacit knowledge (through AR/VR capture), creating living digital apprenticeship libraries that preserve expertise while adapting to new contexts.
* Learning spaces are designed to be both virtual and real, taking into account traditional forms of learning as well as highly innovative formats in their design and architecture.

# project structure across 4 days/ 6 hours each day
  ### Day 1:
  Introduction /Briefing using LiaScript

  ### Day 2:
 Analyze current VET limitations + critique the existing VET theories you've covered in previous seminars + Industry 5.0 principles → identify one vocational field to reimagine and the needs for VET 6.0.

   ### Deliverables at the end of Day 1: 

A comprehensive well documented need analysis report

  ### Day 3:
  Idea Generation /Design the prototype (stakeholders, technology, pedagogy)

   ### Deliverables at the end of Day 2:
 Collaborative MIRO Design Board or LOOPY (design loops) 

   ### Day 4: 
Develop/ Prototype one component (could be an AI tool mockup, an AR/VR prototype, and industry automation workflow, a micro credential structure / learning nugget, a digital portfolio)

  ###  Day 5:
 Present your complete project on 24. January.2026



# Option 2 
  ### CASE SCENARIO
  ### Vision Statement:

 By 2040, VET has dissolved the boundaries between learning, working, and living. Every citizen participates in a continuous cycle of teaching and learning through hyper-localized "skill commons" powered by ambient AI and connected globally through knowledge mesh networks.

# Core Paradigm Shifts:
   ### 1. From Institutions to Living Labs

* Traditional VET schools transform into community innovation hubs where residents solve real local challenges (climate adaptation, care economy, regenerative agriculture)
* Learning happens through "challenge sprints" where mixed-age teams tackle genuine problems
* Certification emerges from documented impact, not seat time

   ### 2. Neuro-Adaptive Learning Interfaces

* Brain-computer interfaces allow direct skill transfer for procedural knowledge (like muscle memory acceleration)
* AI reads cognitive load in real-time, adjusting complexity and providing support exactly when needed
* Haptic exoskeletons enable anyone to perform complex manual tasks while developing genuine competency

   ### 3. Collective Intelligence as Curriculum

* Global "skill genome" maps all human capabilities and constantly evolves based on emerging needs
* Learners co-create learning pathways with AI that draws from humanity's entire knowledge base
* Every master craftsperson's movements, decisions, and intuitions are captured and become teachable patterns

   ### 4. Post-Scarcity Competency Economy

* Universal basic income separates survival from work, making VET purely about mastery and contribution
* Reputation systems replace credentials - your digital twin showcases actual capabilities through verifiable projects
* People fluidly move between roles: sometimes teaching, sometimes learning, sometimes innovating

   #### 5. Biosphere Integration
* VET prioritizes skills for planetary regeneration: mycology-based manufacturing, atmospheric carbon capture, ecosystem restoration
* Students learn to read ecological data as fluently as blueprints
* Every vocational field includes "Earth stewardship" as core competency

# Sample Day in VET 2040
A 17-year-old in rural Germany wakes up with an AI suggesting she join a real-time project: a flooded community in Bangladesh needs rapid housing solutions. She collaborates with a master carpenter in Kyoto, a materials scientist in Lagos, and local residents. Her brain-interface helps her understand traditional bamboo techniques while her exoskeleton guides her hands through joints she's never attempted. By evening, designs are ready for local 3D printing. Her contribution is verified on blockchain, adding to her mastery portfolio. Tomorrow she might teach elderly neighbors to repair electronics, or return to her long-term passion project: developing fungal insulation materials.

# Four-Day Seminar Project
  ### Students create:

 A speculative design prototype for one element of VET 2040

* Policy framework documents
* Documents on the framework conditions for vocational training
* Technology mockups (AR/VR interfaces, AI assistants)
* Assessment/certification alternatives
* Ethical safeguards and equity mechanisms
* Deliverable: A multimedia "artifact from the future" - could be a fictional training manual, a demo video, a policy proposal, or an interactive simulation
